# Like It? Near Real-time Sentiment Analysis on Tweets

**Brief Project Description**

In this project, we are trying to show a More Accurate & Near Real-time SentimentAnalysis on Tweets of Specific Topics.

This project, which combines sentiment analysis andclassification algorithm, will construct a classifier to classify the inputtweets (either collected from real-time twitter stream or entered manually bythe user) to three different categories (positive, neutral, negative) with atleast 2G data retrieved from twitter as training data.

The training process will be performed on the COMP7305 cluster that was built before.

This project will also set up a web UI todemonstrate the classification result of sentiment analysis.

## Getting Started

These instructions will let you apply the project and running on your machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

Following cluster, tools and packages are required to run this project.
```
Hadoop
Spark
Hbase
```
#### Cluster Configuration

### Installing on Ubuntu

#### Python Installation

**Python2.7.6** and **Python3.4.3** are installed by default on ubuntu.Package Installation

#### Package Installation(Take numpy for example)

##### Numpy
```
$ pip install numpy
```
## Data Source (get_tweets)

For more details about twitter data crawling api, please refer to [Twitter Developer Docs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/overview)

``` 
$ python3 get_tweets [user] [datatype] [nums_line] [nums_file] 
```

`e.g. $ python3 get_tweets Tom hist 100 3`

which means use the auth key of **Tom** to get **historical** data, then write these data to the **3** files with **100** lines per file.

For example, the 2.2G data is stored in **total.txt**

## Data Storage (writeHbase)

The original data contains raw tweets, amount fo which is 2.2G.

The table **RawTweet **should be created in base. The the data can be written into hbase.

```
/opt/spark-2.2.1-bin-hadoop2.7/bin/spark-submit --master=yarn writeHbase.py
```

## Data Preprocess (RawTweetCleaner)

The module **textblob** will give the polarity of on tweet, value of which is between -1 and 1. We set the [-1, 0)   as 2, 0 as 0 and (0, 1] as 1 respectively.

Therefor the processed polarity has three values (0, 1, 2).

- **0** means **neutral** sentiment
- **1**means **positive** sentiment
- **2** means **negative** sentiment

After that, the program will construct  json including "text", "polarity" and "id".

The table **RawTrainSet_Json_new **should be created in base. The the data will be cleaned and written into hbase.

```
/opt/spark-2.2.1-bin-hadoop2.7/bin/spark-submit --master=yarn RawTweetCleaner.py
```
Then, the training set has been prepared already.

## Model Training (TrainingModel)

Two models need to be trained, including the **Word2vector** and **RandomForest**

#### Word2vector (TrainingModel/word2vec)

After the model is trained, it will be **saved** in the hdfs.

```
/opt/spark-2.2.1-bin-hadoop2.7/bin/spark-submit --master=yarn word_vector.py
```
#### RandomForest

After the model is trained, it will be **saved** in the hdfs.

```
/opt/spark-2.2.1-bin-hadoop2.7/bin/spark-submit --master=yarn sparkSA_partial.py
```

## SparkStreaming (SparkStreaming_ModelPredict)

#### Pay attetion to the port setting of socket to avoid collision.

Firstly, the **TweetRead.py** should be executed. It is used to get **real-time** tweet from the API provided by Twitter. The data will be sent to **SparkStreaming** real-time through **socket**.

```
python3 TweetRead.py
```
Sencondly, the **SparkStreaming.py** is  executed. The program will **load** the two models including **Word2vector**  and **RandomForest** in initial steps.

The **time window** fo SparkStreaming is set as **10** senconds, meaning the program will collect all real-time tweets in 10 senconds. The model will **predict **the class of all tweets in 10 senconds, after which  the original tweets and class label will be **saved** in txt file for presentation in Web UI.

```
/opt/spark-2.2.1-bin-hadoop2.7/bin/spark-submit --master=yarn SparkStreaming.py
```

## InputText (InputText_ModelPredict)

#### Pay attetion to the port setting of socket to avoid collision.

 The **prediction.py** is  executed. The program will **load** the two models including **Word2vector**  and **RandomForest** in initial steps. It call call the **socket** as server to receive the request and data from the Web backend. After receiving the data, the text will be given the class based on our trained **RandomForest** model and the class label will be returned to the Web backend.

```
/opt/spark-2.2.1-bin-hadoop2.7/bin/spark-submit --master=yarn prediction.py
```

## Web UI (website)

#### Pay attetion to the port setting of socket to avoid collision.

Executing the **main.py** will start the web server and the web interface will be available. 

- For SparkStreaming, **ajax** in web font-end is used to read the file saved by **SparkStreaming.py** to show the original tweets and class label in the Web UI. The textarea of presentation will be refreshed periodicallly.

- For InputText, the text users input wil be sent to **back-end** through **post**. 

  Then back-end use socket to transfer the data to the module **InputText** which will predict the class label of the tweet and return the class label to back-end. 

  The back-end transfer the class label to font-end to show the class label in Web UI.

```
python3 main.py
```
